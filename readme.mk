This project was inspired by my followers on instagram who submitted quotes. I think took their quotes and randomized their quotes and 
authors to create a "wacky" quote. 

The structure of my code was inspired from other students fro the codecademy full stack engineer course. From there I inserted all the quotes
submitted from my followers. Upon clicking the button on the html page, the user then gets a randomized motivational wuote for the day.

Pelase emjoy, this is my first major coding prject.
